# countValidChessMoves
 This code defines countValidChessMoves, which calculates the number of valid moves for chess pieces on an 8x8 board. It checks moves for King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, and Knight based on their movement patterns. Main() reads chessboards from files, counts moves using the function, and compares results with expected values to verify correctness.
